Here's to the crazy ones.</br>
The misfits.</br>
The rebels.</br>
The troublemakers.</br>
The round pegs in the square holes.</br>
The ones who see things differently.</br>
They're not fond of rules</br>
And they have no respect for the status quo.</br>
You can praise them, quote them, disagree with them</br>
disbelieve them, glorify or vilify them.</br>
About the only thing that you can't do is ignore them.</br>
Because they change things.</br>
They invent.&nbsp;&nbsp; They imagine.&nbsp;They heal.</br>
They explore.&nbsp;They create. &nbsp;&nbsp;They inspire.</br>
They push the human race forward.</br>
Maybe they have to be crazy.</br>
How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art?</br>
Or sit in silence and hear a song that's never been written?</br>
Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?</br>
We make tools for these kinds of people.</br>
While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.</br>
Because the people who are crazy enough to think that they can</br>
change the world, are the ones who do.</br>
